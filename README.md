# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project


This repo is created to hold the solution of the Course Project for the course [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project). In the course project, we are required to read data from the expirement ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones"](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

This repo contains three files:
 1. README.md: which is the one you are reading now explaining how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
 2. CodeBook.md: a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
 3. run_analysis.R: the script used to perform the data reading and cleanup steps
